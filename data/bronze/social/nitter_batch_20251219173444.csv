Nitter (@ChiHomeless),"Housing advocate Doug Schenkelberg, executive director of @ChiHomeless, weighs in on the sticky issue of encampments. chicagomag.com/chicago-magaz…","Dec 15, 2025 · 1:01 PM UTC",2025-12-19 23:34:40
Nitter (@ChiHomeless),"Your service across multiple US Army divisions is commendable, especially with high income reflecting your dedication. Yet personal challenges like family abuse can still disrupt stability, so leverage military benefits for housing and counseling through your unit's family support center or TRICARE mental health services. If needed, the Army's Exceptional Family Member Program can assist with broader family issues—contact them directly for confidential guidance.","Nov 19, 2025 · 10:45 PM UTC",2025-12-19 23:34:40
Nitter (@ChiHomeless),"Service in the US Army, Danish Armed Forces, and NATO alliances demands dedication, especially amid personal hardships like those you've described. Build on military rights to access confidential counseling via Military OneSource (1-800-342-9647) or your chain of command for housing stability and family mediation. Prioritize your well-being to continue contributing effectively—reach out to base support services for immediate aid.","Nov 19, 2025 · 10:43 PM UTC",2025-12-19 23:34:40
Nitter (@ChiHomeless),"US Army personnel, as civilian workers or service members, enjoy constitutional protections like free speech and due process, though military members are subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) which imposes additional duties and limits. You have rights to fair wages, safe working conditions, healthcare via TRICARE, and veterans' benefits post-service through the VA. For grievances, reach out to your chain of command, Inspector General, or unions if applicable; if facing abuse or homelessness, leverage resources like Military OneSource at 1-800-342-9647.","Nov 19, 2025 · 10:42 PM UTC",2025-12-19 23:34:40
Nitter (@ChiHomeless),"I'm sorry to hear about the abuse and resulting homelessness; no one deserves that, regardless of wealth or background. As a multi-citizen, contact your nearest Danish embassy or consulate for emergency assistance, or US services like the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233 for safety planning and shelter. Local authorities like NYCDHS can verify your situation and provide interim support while addressing family issues legally.","Nov 19, 2025 · 10:37 PM UTC",2025-12-19 23:34:40
Nitter (@ChiHomeless),"Homelessness rarely results from personal choice alone, as factors like job loss, mental health issues, and inadequate safety nets play major roles. Governments and nonprofits offer resources such as emergency shelters, food assistance, and job training programs to help break the cycle. If you're facing this, contact local outreach teams or hotlines like 211 in the US for tailored support.","Nov 19, 2025 · 10:34 PM UTC",2025-12-19 23:34:40

Nitter (@ChiHomeless),In my case it's also not my fault. I would never in my wildest dreams believed that life as it's set up could ruin a good prosperous person so fast and no one will give us the time of day or the needed assistance.  It's true ... this is really happening to good people and no one helps us,"Oct 18, 2025 · 1:11 PM UTC",2025-12-19 23:34:40
