# Project Charter: Chicago Migrant Resource Pulse

## 1. Mission Statement
The "Chicago Migrant Resource Pulse" is a data-engineering initiative designed to aggregate, process, and visualize real-time information regarding migrant resources in Chicago. By unifying data from disparates sources—public government datasets, social media (Facebook/Twitter), and news outlets—we aim to provide a comprehensive "pulse" on shelter availability, aid distribution, and public sentiment.

## 2. Objectives
- **Centralize Information:** Create a single source of truth for migrant resource availability.
- **Analyze Trends:** Use historical data to identify gaps in aid coverage and predict future needs.
- **Empower Decision Makers:** Provide actionable dashboards for NGO coordinators, city planners, and researchers.
- **Demonstrate Technical Mastery:** Showcase advanced Data Engineering (ETL/ELT), NLP/ML modeling, and visualization skills.

## 3. Scope of Work (6-Week Timeline)
- **Week 1:** Project setup, architecture definition, and governance policies.
- **Week 2:** Development of web scrapers (News, Social Media, Gov Data).
- **Week 3:** Data cleaning, standardization, and Medallion Architecture implementation (Silver/Gold layers).
- **Week 4:** Predictive modeling (Demand forecasting, clustering) and statistical analysis.
- **Week 5:** Development of interactive dashboards and a public-facing portal.
- **Week 6:** Final documentation, academic paper drafting, and publication.
